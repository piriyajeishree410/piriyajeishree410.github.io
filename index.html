            <h2>Hello Boston: First Glances</h2>
            <p>When I first glimpsed Boston through the airport windows, the city was wrapped in a blanket of snow. Coming from the warmth of India to the bite of ‚Äì15¬∞C, it felt like stepping into a snow-globe fairytale.</p>
            <p>Every street, every rooftop, glistened with a beauty both magical and overwhelming, and in that moment, I knew I was far from home yet on the brink of a new chapter.</p>

            <h2>Campus Chronicles: Life between lectures ü§Ø</h2>
            <p>The shift from the Indian to the American education system was nothing short of transformative. It stretched me beyond my comfort zone, challenged the way I thought, and sometimes left me with imposter syndrome.</p>
            <p>Long nights in the library that blurred into mornings, assignments that felt endless, and exams that demanded everything - it was a marathon. Yet, through the exhaustion came resilience, fresh perspectives, and the kind of growth only such intensity can bring.</p>

            <h2>City Stroll: Exploring one street at a time!</h2>
            <p>Though I've always been more of a couch-dweller than an adventurer, Boston coaxed me outdoors. My first true wanderings were during Christmas and New Year's, when the city glittered with lights and joy.</p>
            <p>Other times, I found peace by the Charles River, where even a busy city seemed to pause. I discovered grocery stores, tucked-away restaurants, and even braved my first nightclub, though dancing never quite felt like my rhythm. Boston, with its mix of history and modern vibrance, revealed itself in pieces, each one stitched into my memory.</p>

            <h2>The Inner Journey: Both Solitude and Longing...</h2>
            <p>This journey has turned me inward. I became quieter, more reserved, speaking mostly with my parents and close friends back home, while my social circle here shrank to a dot. Yet, in that solitude, I matured. I learned responsibility ‚Äî that no one else will clean up my mess, that even when I stumble (literally down the stairs), I must care for myself. 
            <p>The struggles, big and small, reshaped me into someone more independent, grounded, and self-reliant. Now I cook meals that comfort me, follow routines that steady me, and carry a strength I never knew I had.</p>
